# MIPS-ASSEMBLY-EXERCISE
We were assigned to implement functions -given n layers of neurons- that recognise the handwritten digit 1 or 7 based on MNIST database by calculating the final output of all layers based on the input array X, the array W containing the weights of each neuron, Layers which contains the number of neurons in each layer and the array B for bias
